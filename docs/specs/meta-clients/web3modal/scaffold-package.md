# Scaffold Package
 
Principal purpose of scaffold package is to "glue" [ui](./ui-package.md) and [core](./core-package.md) packages together into full modal experience.

Scaffold package is responsible for creating complete layouts, views, partials and hooking them up to core logic.

Secondary purpose of this package is to export re-usable class (client) to create Web3Modal instance that bootstraps everything up and can be wrapped in framework friendly apis i.e. react hooks or vue composables.

## Modal
Core modal components like router and modal shell

## Partials
Complex peaces of ui aka widgets that can be re-used in views

## Views
Individual modal views
