# Identity API

## Description 

Identity API exposes methods for registering and un-registering [Identity Keys](identity-keys.md) on the keychain, that will be used by other protocols (Namely [chat](../../chat/README.md) and [notify](../../notify/README.md)). Those keys represent an identity of a blockchain account on a specific device.
