# Shared Key

Shared key is the key derived using both participants key pairs using the elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) key agreement scheme.

The chosen elliptic curve was Curve25519 offering 128 bits of security (256 bits key size) which was specifically designed for ECDH and it's widely supported by many different platforms natively. The name of its DH function is X25519
