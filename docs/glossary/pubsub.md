# PubSub

PubSub (also known as Publish-Subscribe) is a messaging pattern where senders of messages (publishers) do not send messages directly to receivers but instead label messages with a topic that can be listened to by subscribers. Subscribers only receive messages matching the topics that have expressed interest on.
