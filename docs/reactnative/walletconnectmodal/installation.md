# Installation

## Obtain Project ID

Every project that uses WalletConnect SDKs needs to obtain a Project ID from [WalletConnect Cloud](https://cloud.walletconnect.com/sign-in). This process is completely free and only takes a few minutes.

## Add Packages

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="rn-cli" label="React Native CLI">

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @walletconnect/modal-react-native
```

Additionally add these extra packages to help with async storage, polyfills, modals and SVG's.

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @react-native-async-storage/async-storage react-native-get-random-values react-native-modal react-native-svg
```

On iOS, use CocoaPods to add the native modules to your project:

```
npx pod-install
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="expo" label="Expo">

```
npx expo install @walletconnect/modal-react-native
```

Additionally add these extra packages to help with async storage, polyfills, modals and SVG's.

```
npx expo install @react-native-async-storage/async-storage react-native-get-random-values react-native-modal react-native-svg
```

### Additional Setup for Expo SDK 48

If you are using Expo SDK 48, there's an [issue](https://github.com/expo/expo/issues/17270) with `react-native-get-random-values`, so we need to temporarily fix this by installing expo-crypto library and copying [this](https://github.com/WalletConnect/modal-react-native/blob/main/example/expo-crypto-shim.js) file in your root folder.

```
npx expo install expo-crypto
```

#### Apply Polyfill

In your root file, add this line:

```javascript
// Only for Expo SDK 48
import './expo-crypto-shim.js'

...

import { useWalletConnectModal } from '@walletconnect/modal-react-native';
```

* Make sure this line executes before the first `@walletconnect/modal-react-native` import.

### Additional Setup for Expo SDK 49

If you are using Expo SDK 49, there's an [issue](https://github.com/expo/expo/issues/17270) with `react-native-get-random-values`, so we need to manually update it's version to `v1.9.0` and exclude this package from expo validations. For more info, read [Selectively opt out of package version validations](https://blog.expo.dev/expo-sdk-49-c6d398cdf740)

#### Modify your package.json

Exclude `react-native-get-random-values` in your package.json to install a different from the version recommended by Expo.

```json
"dependencies": {
  ...
},
"expo": {
  "install": {
    "exclude": [
      "react-native-get-random-values"
    ]
  }
},
"devDependencies": {
  ...
}
```

#### Install latest version of "react-native-get-random-values"

```bash npm2yarn
npm install react-native-get-random-values@1.9.0
```
