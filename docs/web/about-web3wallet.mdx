# About Web3Wallet

The Web3Wallet SDK allows you to easily connect your Web3 wallet with dapps. It provides a simple and intuitive interface for dapps to request actions such as signing transactions and interacting with smart contracts on the blockchain. The SDK is designed to work with any blockchain, making it easy to support multiple chains without the need for separate integration code.
